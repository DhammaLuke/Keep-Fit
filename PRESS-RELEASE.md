#### From the Project Owner: ####
  > We made it our goal in creating KeepFit to remove barriers to a healthier lifestyle, simply by using the relationships users already have and the technology at their fingertips.


#### From a current KeepFit user: ####
  > I love how simple and useful KeepFit is. Instead of getting stopped from working out by a lost workout sheet or lack of a training buddy, I want to get in there and rack up those points!
